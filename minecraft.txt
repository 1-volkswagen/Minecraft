 Hex - Minecraft Storage
 -----------------------

 In case you want to store your private key on an original and creative manner you can follow the underlying guide to set your imagination free.

 For starters you need to have the following at your disposal:

 - Minecraft: Education Edition (or any other will do)
 - microSD card
 - Private key in hex format

 Lets showcase this method of storing your private key using a random generated private key:

 WWpoqbfhC8qC1GZpFxEHunk1gaU5yDhZe5qJsttaiJZTXiPKD6mA

 You can get the private key of an addres by using the dumpprivkey command followed by the address in the vcash client:

 Now in order to get the hexdump of this private key we are going to use the following small script in powershell:

 $a = "WWpoqbfhC8qC1GZpFxEHunk1gaU5yDhZe5qJsttaiJZTXiPKD6mA";
 $b = $a.ToCharArray();
 Foreach ($element in $b) {$c = $c + " " + [System.String]::Format("{0:X}", [System.Convert]::ToUInt32($element))}
 $c

 57 57 70 6F 71 62 66 68 43 38 71 43 31 47 5A 70 46 78 45 48 75 6E 6B 31 67 61 55 35 79 44 68 5A 65 35 71 4A 73 74 74 61
 69 4A 5A 54 58 69 50 4B 44 36 6D 41

 This is where the fun part begins, in order for you to store the hex value of the private key you need to figure out a way to
 store a hex value onto a minecraft server.

 Hexadecimals are a set of 16 characters that combined together can form a multitude of asscii characters when transformed,
 0-9 and a-f are the alphanumeric characters used in hex.

 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 a b c d e f

 To build a string of hex in minecraft all you need is to come up with your own encryption scheme.

 In this example I used a very simple scheme that allows me to explain the principle.

 In reality you can make it as complicated as you want and even hide it from possible treasure hunters.

 In this example the red stones represent the top row (numbers), the white stones the bottom row (the 6 letters) and the black stone a zero.

 Reading it from left to right, the number of stones present in one column represent their respective value.

 Character one: red stone, four deep:       4
 Character two: white stone, one deep:      a
 Character three: red stone, six deep:      6
 Character four: white stone, four deep:    d
 Character five: black stone, one deep:     0

 The space in the middle represents a space in the hexadecimal string.

 You can try and decipher the second row of blocks using the same method.

 Transforming the hexadecimal string back to ascii:

 Using a hex to ascii transformation table it is very easy to decipher the hexdecimals back to it's original string.

 Below you will find a table that converts the hex pairs into ascii:

 0 30 a 61 k 6B u 75 E 45 O 4F Y 59
 1 31 b 62 l 6C v 76 F 46 P 50 Z 5A
 2 32 c 63 m 6D w 77 G 47 Q 51
 3 33 d 64 n 6E x 78 H 48 R 52
 4 34 e 65 o 6F y 79 I 49 S 53
 5 35 f 66 p 70 z 7A J 4A T 54
 6 36 g 67 q 71 A 41 K 4B U 55
 7 37 h 68 r 72 B 42 L 4C V 56
 8 38 i 69 s 73 C 43 M 4D W 57
 9 39 j 6A t 74 D 44 N 4E X 58

 Using a piece of paper and a pen you can easily extract the private key from the encryption scheme, the blocks in minecraft and the hex to ascii conversion table.

 You can later import this private key back into the vcash wallet using the importprivkey command followed by the private key.

 To save the private key onto a minecraft map all you need to do is head over to the settings and hit export.

 In this example I have saved the minecraft map with the private key into a file called key.mcworld.

 To open the map, all you need to do is open minecraft and press import.

 To save the file and store it offline you need to copy the key.mcworld file onto a microSD card and keep it safe.

 ADVANCED:

 If you really want to be sure no one else other then you has access to the map file you could install the full raspbian image onto a microSD card and run minecraft offline which comes pre-installed.

 Remember to never plug any ethernet cable into the raspberry pi or configure the wifi to keep your cold storage from turning hot.
